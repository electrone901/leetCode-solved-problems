Sliding window technique is useful for solving problems in array or string, especially 
it is considered as a technique that could reduce the time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

Two types of sliding window:
    1. Fixed window length k: the length of the window is fixed and it asks you to find 
       something in the window such as the maximum sum of all windows, the maximum or median 
       number of each window. Usually we need kind of variables to maintain the state of the 
       window, some are as simple as a integer or it could be as complicated as some advanced 
       data structure such as list, queue or deque.
    
    2. Two pointers + criteria: the window size is not fixed, usually it asks you to find the
       subarray that meets the criteria, for example, given an array of integers, find the
       number of subarrays whose sum is equal to a target value.
