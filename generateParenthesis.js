/*
Generate Parentheses
Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed
parentheses.

For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:

[
  "((()))",
  "(()())",
  "(())()",
  "()(())",
  "()()()"
]

Make sure you understand the question

Use "Backtracking" - an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates.
While building our expression left to right, for every index i, we must ensure the number of right parenthesis never exceed the number of left parenthesis in the range [0, i]

A char[] was used instead of a StringBuffer to remove necessity of including a "remove" for every "add" to our expression (when coming out of the recursive call)

Time/Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(2n)
Space Complexity: O(2n)

      We can add this answer and then backtrack so the previous call can exhaust
